# react-native-from-scratch

## This repository was made with learning purposes
### Release builds on iOS fails as React Native is made to use Objective-C.
### For Android, Kotlin is not compatible with JSI, so you are unable to link libraries made with C++ such as `react-native-reanimated` or `react-native-vision-camera`
